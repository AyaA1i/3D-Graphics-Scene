# 3D Scene Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a 3D scene that includes a building and a bicycle. Various color models and transformations will be applied to these objects. Additionally, the scene includes interactive elements that allow the user to open and close doors and windows, move the bicycle, and animate its movement around the building. Camera controls will also be implemented for viewing the scene from different angles.

## Features

1. **3D Objects:**
   - **Building:** Includes at least 2 floors, a roof, one door, and four windows.
   - **Bicycle:** A 3D bicycle model.

2. **Color Models:**
   - Apply suitable colors to each part of the building.
   - Change the background color to green.
   - Apply black color to the 3D bicycle.

3. **Transformations on Building:**
   - **Open Door:** Use the key `o` to open the door.
   - **Close Door:** Use the key `c` to close the door.
   - **Open Windows:** Use the key `O` to open the windows.
   - **Close Windows:** Use the key `C` to close the windows.

4. **Transformations on Bicycle:**
   - **Move Forward:** Use the key `f` to move the bicycle forward along the X-axis.
   - **Move Backward:** Use the key `b` to move the bicycle backward along the X-axis.
   - **Rotate Right Wheel:** Use the key `r` to rotate the right wheel.
   - **Rotate Left Wheel:** Use the key `l` to rotate the left wheel.

5. **Automatic Movement:**
   - The bicycle will move in a circular path around the building.
   - **Enable Animation:** Use the left mouse button to start the bicycle's circular movement.
   - **Disable Animation:** Use the right mouse button to stop the bicycle's circular movement.

6. **Camera Control**
   - Control the camera coordinates to view the 3D scene from different directions.
